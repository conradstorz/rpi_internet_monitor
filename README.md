# README #

This code was originally found as part of a project on instructables.com
It is designed to be run on a RaspberryPi
I intend to extend it to all linux platforms.
On RaspberryPi the GPIO pins will be available for red/yellow/green indicator lights.
Other forms of external light control might be implemented for other platforms.


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
